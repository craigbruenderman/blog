## Overview

It's been years since I've touched Fortinet in any meaningful way, so I'm taking a fresh look at their portfolio. For some customers, OEMs with strong integrated portfolios are a better fit that picking best of breed products a la carte. I can steel-man both of these arguments, but I'll leave that to the analysts. Suffice to say, Fortinet is the only OEM in the upper-right for wired and wireless LANs, SD-WAN, and SASE, so it's worth a look.

## Components

Here's a lkist of the kit I've got to evaluate.
