## VXLAN

VXLAN is an IETF RFC 7348 defined data-plane encapsulation protocol for transporting Layer-2 inside Layer-3 using IP/UDP. This approach takes a Layer-2 frame, adds a new VXLAN header to it while mapping the Layer-2 VLAN to a new construct known as a VXLAN Network Identifiers (VNIs), and encapsulates that newly formatted frame in IP/UDP before transporting amongst gateway devices functioning as VXLAN Tunnel Endpoints (VTEPs).

With encapsulation comes additional headers, which means we have to pay attention to MTU. The VXLAN header is 8-bytes, with 24-bits of that being allocated for the VNI. VXLAN adds up to 54-bytes to a standard Ethernet frame, and VTEPs are not allowed to fragment packets, so we need a minimum MTU of 1554-bytes in the transport path between VTEPs.

### VXLAN Tunnel Endpoint (VTEP)

VTEPs are simply multilayer switches with added hardware capabilities needed to perform this encap/decap, and some other supporting bits and bobs. The chipsets in these VTEPs evolved a bit over time, so not all multilayer switches support VXLAN at all, while others support only subsets of currently used VXLAN techniques.

### VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI)

The VXLAN header has a component known as the VNI, which is functionally similar to the 12-bit VLAN ID (VID) field of an 802.1q header in the Layer-2 world. The VNI is a 24-bit value which serves as the identifier of each broadcast domain VXLAN encapsulates. The 24-bits provide up to 16 million unique VNIs, versus the 4096 VIDs in 802.1q.

As weâ€™ll see, VNIs come in L2VNI and L3VNI flavors, depending on their function. For now, focus on L2VNI, and think of it as a mapping that goes into this new VXLAN frame to keep track of which VLAN to map to.

### MP-BGP

* Address Family Identifier
* Subsequent Address Family Identifier
* AFI 25 = L2VPN
* SAFI 70 = EVPN
  * Indicates the updates contain MAC addresses
* Ethernet VPN is used as an improved control plane for VXLAN
* EVPN is an address family found within MP-BGP
* BGPv4 can only carry IPv4 NLRI
* MP-BGP can carry multiple address families
* EVPN is also used as a control plane for other data planes besides VXLAN
  * E.g., MPLS, PBB, NVO
* MP-BGP UPDATE messages are different
  * Type 14 update MP_REACH_MLRI adds routes
  * Type 15 update MP_UNREACH_NLRI delete routes

### Route Distinguisher

* Locally significant value that is configured on each router
* Used in order to uniquely identify a prefix in the global routing table
* 1:1 association with a VRF
* Can be written
  * ASN:nn
  * IP Address:nn

### Route Targets

* Identifies the VRF a prefix belongs to on the receiving router
* Globally significant among all routers
* 1:1 association with a VRF

## EVPN VXLAN Forwarding

### L2EVPN

In L2EVPN, the whole fabric acts like a single large Layer-2 switch.

### L3EVPN

In L3VPN, the fabric adds in the ability to perform inter-VLAN and general routing.

### BUM Traffic Handling

#### Head End Replication (HER)

* To deal with flooding, one option is to manually define a flood list on each Leaf
* The flood list is a map of which VTEPs have which VLANs
* The Leaf then sends encapsulates and sends multiple unicast messages, one to each VTEP in the list
* When receiving VTEP gets the flood, it learns the source MAC into its MAC-VRF table
* Downside is it is manual and ineffcient
