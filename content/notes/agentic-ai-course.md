# Agentic Systems

## Anthropic Types

* Workflows - systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths
* Agents - systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks

### Workflow Design Patterns

* Prompt Chaining
* Routing
* Parallelization
* Orchestrator-Worker
* Evaluator-Optimizer

### Agents

* Open-ended
* Feedback loops
* No fixed path

#### Risks of Agent Frameworks

* Unpredictable path
* Unpredictable output
* Unpredictable costs
* So, agents need to be monitored and have guardrails to control agent behavior

# Models

* OpenAI gpt-4o-mini
* Anthropic Claude-3-7-Sonnet
* Google Gemini-2.0-flash
* DeepSeek AI Deepseek V3, DeepSeek R1
* Groq open-source LLMs including Llama3.3
* Ollama local open-source LLMs including Llama3.2
