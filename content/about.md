I’m a network architect, working in the IT field since 1999. I live mostly in Louisville, KY, and partially in Humacao, PR with my wife and daughter.

I specialize in automated LAN, SD-WAN and cloud architectures for mid-market and enterprise customers. I have a good deal of experience with IOS-XE, NX-OS, Velocloud, VMWare vSphere, Cisco UCS, F5 and others.

I’ve collected a number of certifications along the way, including CCIE Datacenter #46341.
